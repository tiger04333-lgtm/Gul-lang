# Gul-lang
Gul-lang is an esoteric programming language inspired by Korean Oyster Bars (Pocha). Code is written like shouting orders: lengthen your "Oyster" (Gu...ul) sounds to determine values, and use "Steam" (Jjim) to output text. It features a unique vowel-length value system and continuous output serving.
